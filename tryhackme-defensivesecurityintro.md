I completed the Defensive Security Intro room on June 26, 2025. In this room, I learned foundational defensive concepts like how to protect systems from malware and how to block IP addresses associated with malicious activity. It gave me a solid overview of how defenders think and operate in cybersecurity, and I found it really interesting to see the other side of what I learned in the offensive track. This experience helped me understand how important it is to build layers of protection to keep networks secure.
